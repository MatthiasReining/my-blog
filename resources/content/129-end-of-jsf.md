Red Hat will not push JSF as front end technology in the future. This is more or less the message from Brian Leathem from Red Hat in his blog post "[RichFaces will pursue a path of stability over innovation](http://www.bleathem.ca/blog/2014/07/richfaces-will-pursue-stability-over-innovation.html)"

When Red Hat, as one of the strongest Java EE providers, takes such a decision, I believe this will have an impact of the future of JSF and in the end to the Java EE spec.

JSF was a good technology and it has its time - but the time is over!

Now for me, JAX-RS and HTML5 are THE front-end technologies. Try it, love itâ€¦ ;-)
