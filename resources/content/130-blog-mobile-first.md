After some emails from google that a responsive design will become more and more important for the page rank, I  thought: I must change something.

My first thought: change the templates to Twitter Bootstrap and everything is fine.

But than I realized that my last blog entry is more than a half year old... 

Instead of changing only the design, maybe it makes sense to rethink the complete blog.

Therefore, I will think what's the best for the future of this blog. 

Maybe I have only schedule a fix periodic day as calendar entry for my self to write a blog entry. The first blog entry could deal with how to change this blog to responsive design ;-)
Or, I kill this blog and stop my blogger carrier.

Now, I first start rethinking of the blog...
